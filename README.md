## API Documentation Update Process For BitGo Employees

Any time a new commit is pushed to the remote master branch, Jenkins will run Slate (our API documentation generator) and convert the `index.html.md` file into HTML. This HTML can be viewed at https://bitgo.github.io/bitgo-docs/.

### Steps to Update Documentation at https://bitgo.github.io/bitgo-docs/

1. Review `index.html.md`, making sure the changes are correct
2. `arc diff` the changes for review, and then land it once it's accepted
3. Go to https://bitgo.github.io/bitgo-docs/ to make sure HTML is correct

### Steps to Update Documentation at bitgo.com/api

1. Perform the above steps for updating the docs at https://bitgo.github.io/bitgo-docs/
2. `git checkout` the `gh-pages` branch, which will contain the files and directories generated by Slate
3. Copy all folders and files into the BitGo client repository's static/api/ directory
4. Run the server locally and go to http://localhost:3000/api and make sure the HTML is correct
4. Create a diff in the BitGo client repository and land it once it's accepted

If you try to get Slate to run on your machine, you should note that currently (as of 2017-05-05) there is an issue on the "master" branch of github.com/lord/slate. You want to fork off from the "dev" branch instead and use ruby 2.3 instead of ruby 2.4.
